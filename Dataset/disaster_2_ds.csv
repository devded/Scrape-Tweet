"What happened in Lebanon is absolutely a horrific disaster. 
Please, do not compare it to #Hiroshima . 
70,000 people were killed instantly by that bomb, 200,000+ after injured after radiation. 
Lebanon is horrifying in it's own right, but you do not need to equate the two. (1/5)"

Why are Karen and River on Pillow Talk? They are so annoying and were such a disaster for Chantelle and Pedro that I could do without ever seeing them again. They are the craziest family I've ever seen.

Speechless after seeing the devastation in Beirut. The last time a disaster in a city had hit me so hard it was 11th Sep 2001. They coped because they had the funds and they had international support. It will take yrs for Beirut to get back all what she has lost.
