"Macron is not a Lebanon's friend.
In real, he came to be a tax perceptor as a ""Dracula on Lebanon's neck"". In France he put in jail more than 10.000 people, 10.000 peaceful protestors aka ""gilets jaunes"".
3 years of Macron in France = 3 years of democratic/social regressions."
"Go look up George Webb (truth leaks) on twat. He tied the Ukrainian oligarch that the FBI raided to:  Lebanon blast, Hezbollah, and billionaires that are actually the global cabal. And they are all the same ppl that was involved with the first dossier. Manifort, (rich people)"
"You are wrong , we need France and any help from other countries. And he we welcome Him to Lebanon whenever he want, nobody can stop him and I said nobody."
Jacob don't be so naive. What you'll find is that some interests in Lebanon will look to the French to solve this problems vis-a-vis other groups. The French & the weste will have their own agenda. Other groups won't sit on their hands & before you know it you have a civil war.

"That's true, but some drones are flying lower than usual. 

We used to hear the sound and rarely see it, now it's too easily seen with the naked eye over south Lebanon. This and the IDF needs to end this tension and Hezbullah needs a target. That's why it's a likely scenario."
thats not possible 😂😂 they couldnt do that in 2006 and hezb has progressed ktir since then plus iran wouldnt allow it they have no problem letting all of lebanon burn to the ground before that happens. and israel's behavior in syria w 3al 7dud wl tayaran is begging for a fight

Trump not acknowledging more people are dying in the US from COVID than people died in Lebanon 🤦🏼‍♂️ #PressConference
Hey guys just came on here to talk about something please pray for Lebanon more than 100 people have died and stayed homeless due to the explosion please do anything to help them! #PrayForLebanon

Trump says he will join international aid conference call for Lebanon $WHRhttps://newsfilter.io/articles/trump-says-he-will-join-international-aid-conference-call-for-lebanon-13041cecb4d5425d1a1872ff23c74c0c …
"“We haven’t seen anything like this in a long time,” Trump says of the scale of death in Lebanon. Has he talked to the CDC lately? 2000 people were reported dead from COVID in the US yesterday"
Expressed more condolences for the victims of the blast in Lebanon than he had for the 160K Corona Virus in the US.
"You think Trump knows? He doesn't even know Beirut is in Lebanon, or that Puerto Rico is part of the US"
"People really recorded the Lebanon explosion with good camera angles, and y’all can’t even record a school fight 🤦🏽‍♂️"
He’s talking about Lebanon. Motherfuckers are starving.
"So Trump will send condolences to the people of Lebanon, but says “it is what is” about deaths of the American people?? #TrumpIsACompleteFailure #COVID__19 #trumppresser #trumpPressBriefing"
Lebanon should be the only ones covering it. He's giving them more love then dead Americans.
"ik i seem like “soft oomf/moot” but i will never allow open disrespect of someone’s identity, believe that"
Good to know the President could give condolences to the people of Lebanon before the 160k in his own country
"So @POTUS sends three planes to #lebanon and says this is like nothing seen before. He forgot, like always, of @PuertoRicoPUR"
"This DICK President mentions the death toll in Lebanon but never mentions the 165,000 dead in America of the Trump virus"
"Well, I think it depends on what they asked for. 3 C-17s is a drop in the bucket but its help that can be sent now and could turn out to be many more if needed. But Lebanon may not want US help either."

Not necessarily but that’s an average. Also you need to remember the fire rate will decrease after the first days of the war. The firepower brought against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon would be unprecedented. Their ability to launch will be impacted.

"So you're saying we still shouldn't reach out for peace and essentially take the moral low ground, digging our heels in?  Let Lebanon hate Israel, but we need to show the people of Lebanon that we don't hate them.  Then there may be change."
"But why so much AN stored there and who did it belong to?

It's in a port w/easy access by ship/boat so nice location to dispense AN to terror organizations. Hezbollah is based in Lebanon. 

Lebanon used to be the Riviera of the Middle-East. Now, it's on the verge of collapse."

""I work over here. Devastating explosion. 2750 tons of Ammonia Nitrate sitting for 7 years or more. Welding done, seam was probably left hot, fireworks or munitions and in an instant......"""
where are all the lebanon carrds and other stuff they just all disappeared on my tl???? did everyone just collectively stop talking abt it on my tl or
Hummm beyrut is in Lebanon... And that was an explosion from unchecked storage of ammonium nitrate... Using such a tragedy to convey political ideas is beyond disgusting
it’s the way everyone is silencing the issues going on in lebanon right now with a stupid dm that could’ve been tweeted publicly & they were small accounts and their triggering tweets had specific words you wouldn’t be typing up in the first place ??
Ya rab I’m praying for Lebanon 🇱🇧 I just watched a video and my heart aches for them

Lebanon have all my love. Not the first time the protests have been ringing out. They finally got some results.
Nobody cares. This government is corrupt and they use proxies to hide their interest. They also use farms/cattle to launder money. Lebanon's Prime minister and the entire cabinet resigned after deadly blast caused by government's negligence. #SACabinetResign
i hope you win 🥰🥰
It's strange the govt of Lebanon has more shame than the GOP.
Lebanon's Prime Minister stepping down is the result of protests. Protests fueled by desperation where the PM absolutely knew without any doubt that there were two ways things end - he's either carried out by force or he resigns. We haven't reached that point yet here.
