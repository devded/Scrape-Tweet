For sure but the operative word will be negligence. Canberra bushfires easy example. Lots of level of gov in ACT found negligent in not reducing fire loads in the bush land (from memory). Insurers paid out tens (100s) of millions as a result as they insured the governments.
"Yes and they also have the big data on all historical losses paid by loss type. Flood bushfire cyclone hail storm, you name it they‚Äôve got the data! Uninsurable then government wakes up and legislates that it‚Äôs not they prob cause they can‚Äôt afford to pay for it."
