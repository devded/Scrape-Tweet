Have you seen the press conference in Illinois where it‚Äôs explained how of you die in any manner and you happen to be Covid positive it is counted as a Covid death. Die in a car accident but Covid positive- you are now part of that death rate.

As a math guy you‚Äôll know you have a better chance of dying in a car accident than dying from COVID. You‚Äôll understand that more positive test cases are not unexpected and that the hysteria over the increase in positive cases is kind of irrelevant since death rate is decreasing
