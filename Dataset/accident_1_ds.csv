You can't control or stop an accident but you sure could control & stop covid by following certain practices & taking precautions. People die from covid due to inaction by those in power.
Some don’t.   Some die of undiagnosed heart issues.  Some die of the flu.  Some die of car accidents driving home from practice.  You can’t get risk to zero.  It’s a subjective risk assessment.  And this is one of the few areas where you are more conservative than I am.
